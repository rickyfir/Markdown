# Basic writing and formatting syntax

## Headings

to create heading, add on to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading. for example:

```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

and the rendered output must be like this:

# The largest heading

## The largest second heading

###### The largest smallest heading

## Bold
This text is **bold**.  
**text all bold**

## Italic
*hello*.

This text is ***really important***.

## All bold and italic
**_All text is important_**.
